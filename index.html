            <h3>But what is this about?</h3>
            <p>On any given day, users of computers everywhere go through a motley of apps and systems that manage data,
                transfer it between other computers, and then are able to process and display it in a format that best
                suits the needs of the user. But under the hood, these seemingly standalone programs often have a clear
                and traceable history of development that takes inspiration from or directly implements the code of
                other (past) projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                It does make one ponder if there is some underlying relation between the people
                working on these products and to what degree and in what form do these parallels are drawn.
            </p>
            <p>I aim to
                answer the question: to what extent do the factors of educational level, professional standing, and
                shared development heritage play a role in how similar the code of software products are.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout this, I will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>go over the current status quo of academic studies assessing this similarity and what measure are
                    being employed to quantify and develop on their findings</li>
                <li>show how the development of free and
                    open source software projects like the operating system unix with its ancestors BSD and Linux
                    present
                    themselves as a superb model for how different software products can be simultaneously created and
                    actively maintained from a ‚Äúsoftware core‚Äù.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Parallel Development? What's that?</h3>
            <p>In order to ascertain how software products develop in a way that draws from previous software, it is
                necessary to delve into what parallel development is. In short, it is when 2 or more groups of
                developers
                (companies or open source groups) take an existing software product and extend onto it with features
                specific to what the user base of that group needs <cite>(Zhang and Becker, 1)</cite>.</p>
            <p>For example, the codebase of an
                imaging app could be used by one company to develop a method for enabling the mobile depositing of
                checks,
                while another company could be displaying 3D augmented reality models of products that could fit in your
                home. In both these cases, the apps independently, but simultaneously developed the ability (via code)
                for
                the phone to track markers on objects the camera sees such as the signature line on checks, or invisible
                points on the floor for setting the origin of the AR model.</p>
            <div class="side-by-side">
                <figure>

                        alt="Amazon AR Tech">
                    <figcaption><small>Amazon's AR capable view of products</small></figcaption>

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>While the implementation of this tracking
                ability may be similar, it is worthwhile to note these similarities are of great concern in the case of
                patents or trademarks on how that process is accomplished, or if there is a bug in the implementation of
                one
                of the products and the other product is looking to extend the bug fix for that issue into their own
                codebase. When these similarities arise, it is often because a lot of the functionality from the base
                app
                (the ‚Äúsoftware core‚Äù) like the imaging app exposes its functionality in such a way that it is nigh
                unavoidable to structure your code in a specific way to handle the control flow and results from their
                functions.</p>
            <p>All of these considerations play a part into why parallel development is an extremely important
                field to study and analyse.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Open source and Unix</h3>
            <p>It is worthwhile to note that the focus of this study was on the unix operating system and its ancestors,
                specifically the BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) and Linux operating systems as they have an easily
                traceable ancestry with minor changes between the source code, all while being FOSS (free and open
                source
                software) allowing for full analysis into its inner workings along with a complete edit history going
                back
                to the 80s <cite>(‚ÄúLinus Torvalds‚Äù, 2020)</cite>.</p>
            <p>Because of this, it is a prime model of discussion when it comes to
                software projects and how they evolve. As such, it is worth taking a look at the unix family as a sort
                of
                case study to center the goals of this paper around. The Linux project in particular has a large number
                of
                people contributing to its development on a monthly basis, encompassing a wide variety of developers at
                different levels in their career.</p>
            <p>The study from Davis and Jabeen in 2011 titled ‚ÄúLearning in the GNU/Linux
                community‚Äù looked at 4603 people who contributed to the Linux project and conducted a 21 question survey
                intended to look at the general demographic of the base. They found that when splitting up the age
                groups
                into 4 year slices like 18-22 and 33-37, variability in age was not very large as nearly all groups had
                equal percentages <cite>(2, Fig. 2)</cite>.</p>
            <div class="solo">
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/LinuxCommunity.png" alt="Survey results of the Linux community">
                    <figcaption><small>The results of the Linux community survey</small></figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>This is important because it rules out the notion that older universities and
                teachings would dominate the ways of thinking and ultimately the design of the source code, at least
                when it
                comes to new developments in the project.</p>
            <p>Additionally, they looked into the End-User roles (the equivalent
                of profession standing), and found that 40% of people were in advanced (senior level) roles, with people
                in
                beginning (junior level) roles not too far behind at 34% and developing (intern level or interested in
                the
                industry) roles much further down at 24% <cite>(2, Fig. 4)</cite>.</p>
