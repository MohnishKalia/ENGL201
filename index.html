                <h3>But what is this about?</h3>
                <p>On any given day, users of computers everywhere go through a motley of apps and systems that manage
                    data,
                    transfer it between other computers, and then are able to process and display it in a format that
                    best
                    suits the needs of the user. But under the hood, these seemingly standalone programs often have a
                    clear
                    and traceable history of development that takes inspiration from or directly implements the code of
                    other (past) projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It does make one ponder if there is some underlying relation between the people
                    working on these products and to what degree and in what form do these parallels are drawn.
                </p>
                <p>I aim to
                    answer the question: to what extent do the factors of educational level, professional standing, and
                    shared development heritage play a role in how similar the code of software products are.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout this, I will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>go over the current status quo of academic studies assessing this similarity and what measure
                        are
                        being employed to quantify and develop on their findings</li>
                    <li>show how the development of free and
                        open source software projects like the operating system unix with its ancestors BSD and Linux
                        present
                        themselves as a superb model for how different software products can be simultaneously created
                        and
                        actively maintained from a ‚Äúsoftware core‚Äù.</li>

                <h3>Parallel Development? What's that?</h3>
                <p>In order to ascertain how software products develop in a way that draws from previous software, it is
                    necessary to delve into what parallel development is. In short, it is when 2 or more groups of
                    developers
                    (companies or open source groups) take an existing software product and extend onto it with features
                    specific to what the user base of that group needs <cite><a href="#citation-2">(Zhang and Becker,
                            1)</a></cite>.</p>
                <p>For example, the codebase of an
                    imaging app could be used by one company to develop a method for enabling the mobile depositing of
                    checks,
                    while another company could be displaying 3D augmented reality models of products that could fit in
                    your
                    home. In both these cases, the apps independently, but simultaneously developed the ability (via
                    code)
                    for
                    the phone to track markers on objects the camera sees such as the signature line on checks, or
                    invisible
                    points on the floor for setting the origin of the AR model.</p>

                <p>While the implementation of this tracking
                    ability may be similar, it is worthwhile to note these similarities are of great concern in the case
                    of
                    patents or trademarks on how that process is accomplished, or if there is a bug in the
                    implementation of
                    one
                    of the products and the other product is looking to extend the bug fix for that issue into their own
                    codebase. When these similarities arise, it is often because a lot of the functionality from the
                    base
                    app
                    (the ‚Äúsoftware core‚Äù) like the imaging app exposes its functionality in such a way that it is nigh
                    unavoidable to structure your code in a specific way to handle the control flow and results from
                    their
                    functions.</p>
                <p>All of these considerations play a part into why parallel development is an extremely important
                    field to study and analyse.</p>

                <h3>Parallel Development ‚Æï Variant Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Within the realm of software development, the similarities between the codebases of different
                    products has been thoroughly analysed. It might seem to be exeedingly difficult to visualize how the
                    code
                    of software projects are structured and to what extent similar
                    constructions arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, in academia, this topic has been studied for a decade at this point
                    under the name ‚Äúvariant analysis‚Äù <cite><a href="#citation-1">(Duszynski and Becker 2012,
                            1)</a></cite>.
                    Within this landmark study, they look at potential methods in order to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>assess the degree to which those commonalities in source code arise such as existing AI models
                        that check for plagiarism in academic assignments</li>
                    <li>detail a novel approach that involves
                        diagramming out the occurrences of certain code sections that perform a trivial operation across
                        different files</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="solo">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./images/VAProcess.png" alt="Variant Analysis process">
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In addition to looking into specific code sections, the approach detailed in the
                    paper also addresses another end result of the analysis that obtains a structural similarity,
                    preying on the fact that products in parallel development ‚Äúwere cloned from one another at some
                    point in time‚Äù and as such ‚Äúthey still retain some structural similarity despite later
                    modifications‚Äù <cite><a href="#citation-1">(Duszynski and Becker 2012, 3)</a></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This "variant analysis" has exeedingly large utility: they document if other variants contain
                    similar code to what you are working on or if the
                    variants can be combined while still keeping the functionality intact.
                </p>
                <p>This is useful for when one is
                    trying to fix a bug or port over a feature from another program.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>Furthermore, this
                    analysis is metricized to the point where the results can be tabulated and plotted on a bar chart,
                    as well as
                    diagrammed via venn diagrams to show just how much code is similar between two variants.

                <h3>Open source and Unix</h3>
                <p>It is worthwhile to note that the focus of this study was on the unix operating system and its
                    ancestors,
                    specifically the BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) and Linux operating systems as they have an
                    easily
                    traceable ancestry with minor changes between the source code, all while being FOSS (free and open
                    source
                    software) allowing for full analysis into its inner workings along with a complete edit history
                    going
                    back
                    to the 80s <cite><a href="#citation-6">(‚ÄúLinus Torvalds‚Äù, 2020)</a></cite>.</p>
                <p>Because of this, it is a prime model of discussion when it comes to
                    software projects and how they evolve. As such, it is worth taking a look at the unix family as a
                    sort
                    of
                    case study to center the goals of this paper around. The Linux project in particular has a large
                    number
                    of
                    people contributing to its development on a monthly basis, encompassing a wide variety of developers
                    at
                    different levels in their career.</p>
                <p>The study from Davis and Jabeen in 2011 titled ‚ÄúLearning in the GNU/Linux
                    community‚Äù looked at 4603 people who contributed to the Linux project and conducted a 21 question
                    survey
                    intended to look at the general demographic of the base. They found that when splitting up the age
                    groups
                    into 4 year slices like 18-22 and 33-37, variability in age was not very large as nearly all groups
                    had
                    equal percentages <cite><a href="#citation-5">(2, Fig. 2)</a></cite>.</p>

                <p>This is important because it rules out the notion that older universities and
                    teachings would dominate the ways of thinking and ultimately the design of the source code, at least
                    when it
                    comes to new developments in the project.</p>
                <p>Additionally, they looked into the End-User roles (the equivalent
                    of profession standing), and found that 40% of people were in advanced (senior level) roles, with
                    people
                    in
                    beginning (junior level) roles not too far behind at 34% and developing (intern level or interested
                    in
                    the
                    industry) roles much further down at 24% <cite><a href="#citation-5">(2, Fig. 4)</a></cite>.</p>

                    people working on the Linux project are definitely more exposed to the industry and thus have most
                    likely formed their own best practices or opinions on how certain code is structured.
                </p>
                <p>As such, it is
                    entirely plausible that a certain portion of variant similarity comes from like minded people
                    currently working in enterprise jobs that have been told throughout their career that ‚Äúthis is the
                    best way of doing this task‚Äù and simply talking that dogmatism to heart.</p>
                <p>Another side of this is comes from noting that a lot of these developers that fit into the 74% of the
                    senior and junior levels are often
                    contributing as part of or on the side of jobs that they take from development titans such as Intel
                    and Huawei. These companies have their own style guides on
                    how they want code to be structured that tend to be quite similar to one another, increasing
                    stylistic similarity.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Also these companies often have hiring requirements that encourage higher-level
                    education and as such, they would be more exposed to an interpretation of software development that
                    comes from more globalized, generalized, and standardized university curriculums, eventually
                    producing similar code.</p>

                <h3>Rigged from the start</h3>
                <p>A lot of the dogmatism and standardization manifest in the works of one of the largest
                    as well as earliest contributors (and also the current maintainer of the Linux project) Linus
                    Torvalds.</p>
                <p>Linus has had a tremendous impact on the progress, accessibility, and state of the Linux operating
                    system over the course of nearly 2 decades via aligning with
                    a <q>common practice among software developers at the time, he released the source code, which meant
                        that
                        anyone with knowledge of computer programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes</q>
                    <cite><a href="#citation-6">(‚ÄúLinus Torvalds‚Äù, 2020)</a></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>This practice most likely was what led a more recent look
                    into variant analysis in 2017 by <cite><a href="#citation-3">Tenev et al</a></cite> to find that the
                    number of lines of code that were similar enough to be considered ‚Äúshared‚Äù between some
                    different distributions of unix was always greater than 50% of the total, while the number of unique
                    lines
                    of code was
                    significantly smaller, never going above 50%.</p>
                <div class="solo">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./images/DistroBar.png" alt="Bar chart of code similarity between unix distros">
                        <figcaption><small>Bar chart of the code similarity between tested distributions</small>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>This demonstrates that while novel code can be written in
                    great quantities, practically, there is a large amount of overlap between the code structure that
                    manifests itself in products that are in common utility.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Where does this lead us?</h3>
                <p>It
                    does appear that previous research has already assessed just how much of the cross-distribution bug
                    fixes as detailed in the introduction can be done.</p>
                <p>In accordance with <cite><a href="#citation-7">Dietrich et al</a></cite>, an analysis into the
                    granularity of unix (how certain changes affect the end functionality of unix functions in general)
                    found that as long as the changed code has more to do with the configuration of a program and the
                    way it
                    is built rather than changing internals of the programming languages, most of the changes should be
                    transferable between Linux versions.</p>
                <p>This works because most developers would not be tinkering with changes to language implementations,
                    and would
                    instead be tasked with collectivising the functionality of the operating systems into something that
                    works for a specific product of their company.</p>
                <div class="side-by-side">
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Additionally, there are more than a thousand distributions
                    of Linux that are able to fit the needs of specific products, like those of mobile and embedded
                    systems
                    all the way to large networking and cloud computing operations; the utility of having these
                    individual
                    solutions be applied to many parallel products is unparalleled <cite><a
                            href="#citation-8">(LWN.net)</a></cite>.</p>
                <p>In the theoretical sense, it is shown that improvements and fixes local to one product can be applied
                    to the litany of Linux distros out in the wild. Hopefully, this resulted in a better understanding
                    of how interconnected the apps of today are and how progressive change results in the ability to
                    create
                    these grand hierarchies of software and its history.</p>
